# ERC-20 LOIC Token

All the information about this token can be found on **[its official website](https://loic.finance/)**.

To contact me, you can use [GitHub](https://github.com/LoicE5), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loic-etienne/) or [loic.etienne@mail.com](mailto:loic.etienne@mail.com).

This project is divided in three differents parts :

## Token

The LOIC token is conform to the ERC-20 standard and uses the Solidity language, created for the Ethereum blockchain.
<br>
The 0.5.0 pragma solidity version is involved for this contract.
<br>
The token file is at the root of the repo, and is named `token.sol`. It is divisible up to 10 decimals.

I made this token following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDq7r1n9zIU)'s instructions, frome the [Code With Joe YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdgU4pljNproO0RQVbT5QKg).

It is currently not valuated nor exchangeable. I'll keep this document updated if this changes if the future.

You can view the LOIC token on **[EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x61da01d94b1c7c347277e8d6650c1a46dd5ec859)**.

## 3D Model

In order to illustrate this token, I made a 3D Model of it using Blender.

Basically, this model is a photo of me put into a 3D Ethereum coin. I also made an animation that makes the coin spin around.
<br>
The goal for this 3D model is to illustrate the website.

You can find this model in *`3d-model/loic_coin_3d.blend`*.

I made this model using [Arthur](https://sketchfab.com/Arthur_mf)'s work on *SketchFab*. All my thanks to him for his work.

## Website

To get validated by EtherScan and display an icon on MetaMask and other platforms, I have to create a website for my token.

The website [loic.finance](https://loic.finance/) is created using HTML and CSS.

The 3D token that you can see above is integrated using HEVC encoding (for Safari, supports transparency) and VP9 (for Chromium & Firefox, also supports transparency).

The starfield was originally created by [Saransh Sinha](https://codepen.io/saransh) on *CodePen*. All my thanks to him for his work as well.

Everything else on this website have been created by me. Feel free to fork it to use it as a template for your project, or to suggest any improvement :).

I made the logo using Canva.
